# RsCodingChallenge

- Your task is to let the user set the corner for each element
- The element supports many more styles but for this challenge we focus on the corners design
- The element supports different style values for each breakpoint. For simplicity of this challenge we assume there is only one breakpoint
- The user should be able to change all borders at once by pressing the “link” button
- The user should also be able to set each corner value individually
